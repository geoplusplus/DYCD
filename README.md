DYCD

Dynamic Change Detection

This is a developing project. The current version still works very slow, so the algorithm is not released. 

The current achievement is to compares two segmentation algorithms with parameters, selected by an unsupervised segmentation evaluation, and develops a spatiotemporal tracking technique. 

Those are the implementations of segmentation algorithms using the scikit-image package, and the segmentation evalutation, which is based on Liau (2014).
